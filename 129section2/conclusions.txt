Conclusions:

1. Time Complexity Trends:
   - Graham Scan/Monotone Chain: O(n log n)
   - Quickhull: O(n log n) average case
   - Jarvis March: O(nh)

2. Variance Impact:
   - Runtime is independent of coordinate range/variance.
   - Gaussian vs. Uniform: Minor differences due to hull complexity.

3. Runtime Distributions (n=50):
   - Graham Scan/Monotone Chain: Tight distributions.
   - Quickhull: Moderate variance.
   - Jarvis March: Widest distribution.
